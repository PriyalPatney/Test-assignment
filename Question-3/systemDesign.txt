1)  Centralized Update Server:
    Set up a centralized update server in the intranet that stores the latest version of the application and all updates. The server should be accessible to all 25 computers in the intranet.

2)  Update Schedule:
    Establish a regular update schedule, such as once a week or twice a month, to ensure that all computers are up-to-date with the latest version of the application.

3)  Notification System:
    Develop a notification system that will alert all computer users about the upcoming update schedule, and remind them to save their work and close the application before the update process begins.

4)   Automated Update Process:
    Set up an automated update process on each computer that will connect to the centralized update server and download and install the latest version of the application.

5)   Verification Process:
    After the update process is completed, perform a verification process to ensure that the application is working properly on each computer. If there are any issues, troubleshoot and resolve them as necessary.

6)   Backup and Rollback:
    Perform a backup of the existing application on each computer before the update process begins. This will enable you to roll back to the previous version if necessary.

7)   Monitoring and Maintenance:
    Monitor the update process and the application on each computer regularly to ensure that everything is working smoothly. Perform maintenance tasks, such as clearing temporary files and optimizing system performance, to ensure that the application runs smoothly on each computer.

8)  Documentation:
    Create documentation for the entire update process, including the update schedule, notification system, automated update process, verification process, backup and rollback, and monitoring and maintenance tasks. This documentation will help to ensure consistency and efficiency in the update process and will be useful for troubleshooting any issues that may arise.
